registry2-bundle
================

**Version 2.1.0 adds some BC for registry.switchEngineType() and replaced
registry.isMode() with registry.isEngineType().**

**This is the new version 2 of registry-bundle. It breaks the API of version 1!**

This bundle provides a key-value data store, persisted by the Symfony entity
manager or a Redis store using [SncRedisBundle](https://github.com/snc/SncRedisBundle).
